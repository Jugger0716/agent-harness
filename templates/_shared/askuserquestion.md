# User Interaction Rules — Shared (single source)

All user-facing questions MUST use AskUserQuestion tool when available.
- If AskUserQuestion is available → use it (provides numbered selection UI)
- If AskUserQuestion is NOT available or fails → present the same options as text and accept number/keyword responses (case-insensitive)
- Every option must include a `label` (short name) and `description` (specific explanation)
- "Other" (free text input) is automatically appended by the framework
- Translate all question text, labels, and descriptions to `user_lang`
